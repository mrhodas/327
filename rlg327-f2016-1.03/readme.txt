This is a program that randomly creates a set of rooms and cooridoors and displays
them in the system output.

There is a way to find the shortest path to monsters defined by the specification.

I am still typing the monsters and hope to have it down by tomorrow by 9! so i hope it stays open.

The queue is not working...

Adding --nummon will trigger a question about the number of monsters you would like.
